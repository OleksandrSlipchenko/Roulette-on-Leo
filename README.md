## Introduction

Dive into the world of decentralized gaming with our Aleo Roulette Game, written in the Leo language for the Aleo blockchain. Our game ensures a provably fair gaming experience, allowing you to place bets and potentially win big, all while maintaining the highest standards of security and transparency.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Ensure you have Leo installed on your system. If not, you can find the installation guide on the [Aleo documentation](https://developer.aleo.org/leo/installation).

### Running the Game

To get the roulette wheel spinning, you'll use one of the following commands:

```
leo run main <bet_number>
```

Or, to execute on the blockchain:

```
leo execute main <bet_number>
```

Replace `<bet_number>` with the [number or category](#betting-options) you wish to bet on.

## Gameplay

### Placing Bets

To start the game, pass your bet to the `main` function. The bet can be a single number (0-36) or a category (37-43), representing different group bets.

### Game Outcome

After placing your bet, the `finalize main` function will be invoked to determine the winning number. If your bet matches the outcome, you win!
